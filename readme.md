## Notes:

Currently uses Python 3.9

# To build and run from source-code

In two different terminals, do:

## Frontend

- cd into frontend
- `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- `npm start`

## Backend

- cd into backend
- create a new environment (for example, using miniconda or python3's venv at the command line, i.e., `python3 -m venv ./venv` and then `venv/bin/activate`)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
- `uvicorn main:app --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0`

# To run in docker

In two different terminals, do:

## Backend

- cd into backend
- `docker build -t patat-backend .`
- `docker run -p 8080:8080 patat-backend`

## Frontend

- cd into frontend
- `docker build -t patat-frontend .`
- `docker run -p 3000:3000 patat-frontend`

# To run in docker-compose

- install `docker-compose` if you don't have it installed
- `docker-compose up --build --force-recreate ` or `docker compose up --build` (without the hyphen); seems to be machine dependent. Try one if the other doesn't work!
- if you're running on a local machine, go to http://localhost:3000/; if you're running on an AWS machine (see below) then replace localhost with the public IPv4 address

# To view API docs

- head to `http://localhost:8080/docs` after running the backend

# To run in AWS instance
- create an instance with GPU: Instance should have at least 30GBs of local storage
- download the generated keypair and `chmod 400 <FILE.pem>` to make it read-only
- launch instance if its never been launched; use instance state drop-down to restart a stopped instance if its already been launched by stopped.
- copy the files into the instance (either scp the directory from your local machine `scp -i "FILE.pem" -r <DIR> ec2-user@INSTANCE_ADDRESS:` or git clone after sshing into the instance `ssh -i "FILE.pem" ec2-user@INSTANCE_ADDRESS`) where INSTANCE_ADDRESS is the public ipv4 DNS address.
- install docker and docker compose: helpful resources ( to install docker [link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) , to install docker-compose [link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/), to start docker demeaon [link](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/start/)
- Using the Instance UI in Amazon AWS, allow ports 3000 and 8000 to be accessible from your instance inbound and outbound security rules

- ssh in and go to PaTAT-pattern-based-thematic-annotation-tool/frontend/src/assets/base_url.jsx and replace the ip address with your instances public ipv4
- follow the running instructions above to run PaTAT
